\title{Writes a SBML file.}
\usage{
convert2sbml(data, outfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame with the following mandatory colnames: \itemize{
\item \code{"ID":} A list of single character strings containing the reaction abbreviations, Entries in the field abbreviation are used as reaction idâ€™s, so they must be unique.
\item \code{"REACTION":} A set of stoichiometric reaction with the following format: \code{"H2O[c] + Urea-1-carboxylate[c] <=> 2 CO2[c] + 2 NH3[c]"} Where arrows and plus signs are surrounded by a "space character".
It is also expected that stoichiometry coefficients are surrounded by spaces, (nothe the "2" before the CO2[c] or the NH3[c]).
It also expects arrows to be in the form "\code{=>}" or "\code{<=>}". Meaning that arrows like "\code{==>}", "\code{<==>}", "\code{-->}" or "\code{->}" will not be parsed and will lead to errors.,
\item \code{"GPR":} A set of genes joined by boolean operators as AND or OR, rules may be nested by parenthesis. (optional: column can be empty),
\item \code{"LOWER.BOUND":} A list of numeric values containing the lower bounds of the reaction rates. If not set, zero is used for an irreversible reaction and 1000 for a reversible reaction. (optional: column can be empty),
\item \code{"UPPER.BOUND":} A list of numeric values containing the upper bounds of the reaction rates. If not set, 1000 is used by default. (optional: column can be empty),
\item \code{"OBJECTIVE":} A list of numeric values containing objective values for each reaction (optional: column can be empty). 
}}

\item{outfile}{A writable path for the output 'SBML' file to be generated.}
}
\value{
A SBML file.

\description{
This function converts a data.frame to a valid SBML file. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a representation format, based on XML, for communicating and storing computational models of biological processes.

}
\details{
This function takes a data.frame as input and convert it to a valid sbmlR object, then the object is writed into the SBML output file.
